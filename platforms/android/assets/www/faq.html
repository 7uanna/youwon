                                    <p>Giving away free stuff and making Sweepstakes contest sounds like crazy, but there is an economical sense behind it. When you filling up a survey, there is a company willing to pay for the survey because the company wants to learn more about their product. When you are getting a free product, the company who is giving you its free product is confident that their product is that good that you will continue and purchase their product. I hope this explains it:)</p>

                                    <p>When creating the app we did everything in our knowledge to make things as easy and simple to our users. To get free stuff you need to decide what type of free stuff you feel like getting by clicking on one of the 3 sections in the main screen of the app. In the next step just read about the offer and if you think you feel like getting it just click on the "Get It!" button. It's that easy:)</p>
